# Bicker-Quicker

Sometimes when you have a disagreement with someone, you just want a third opinion. Often this opinion comes from friends that have a bias or from strangers online who only hear one side of the story, which then usually leads to meaningless back and forth arguments. Bicker Quicker aims to provide a platform that promotes hearing both sides of an argument, as well as non-argumentative resolution to disagreements. Most arguments online are held on social media, but Bicker Quicker provides a place for streamlined arguments and less toxicity.

Bicker-Quicker is an Android application that uses the real-time Firebase Database.
